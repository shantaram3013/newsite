            <p>I wondered if I should say something as the airport drew nearer.
                The small smile on your lips convinced me otherwise, though. Why ruin things? I was content to watch you
                from the passenger seat.</p>
            <p>It was a little difficult to believe it had only been ... what was it, a day?
                Well, give or take a few hours.
                The plane tickets here and back had been amongst the more expensive ones I&#39;ve bought in my life, but
                I&#39;d have paid thrice as much for what they brought me.</p>
            <p>We&#39;d been to the place you&#39;d been telling me about.
                A little bit of a drive away from the city, but it was worth it - quiet, idyllic, one of those places
                that feels like it&#39;s outside of time.
                To tell you the truth, I&#39;d probably have been be okay anywhere as long as it was with you.</p>
            <p>On the way, we&#39;d talked of many things.
                But we didn&#39;t talk about how sad I&#39;d been, or how sad you&#39;d been, and I didn&#39;t mention
                how much I&#39;d thought of you.
                It&#39;s funny - when you love someone and you&#39;re away from them all you want to do is crawl into
                their arms and tell them how you&#39;ve been and beg them to heal you.
                But when you&#39;re with them you&#39;d rather talk about this funny thing that happened with a guy you
                know, or that new restaurant just outside town, or your favourite way to make pasta.
                It&#39;s like just being with them is healing enough.
                Small salve for one&#39;s wounds.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m glad you came,&quot; you said, breaking the silence and my contemplation.
                I yelped.</p>
            <p>It wasn&#39;t the first time I&#39;d been startled by a sudden noise that trip, but the concern with
                which you approached me afterward every time was unwavering. I hated how jumpy I&#39;d gotten lately.
            </p>
            <p>&quot;You okay?&quot; The little smile on your face vanished, and I cursed myself.
                You furrowed your brow and turned a little to look at me. </p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;ll be fine. You just caught me off guard. I&#39;m glad I came, too,&quot; I replied. </p>
            <p>How was I to tell you that you were all I had left?
                The trip had made life sufferable a little longer.
                When you reached for the shift stick to change gears, I put my hand on yours.
                You didn&#39;t say anything, and we sat there like that a bit.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry I can&#39;t stay longer.&quot;
                My voice came out flat, and before I knew it, I was crying.
                I turned away and covered my face with my hand in a desperate bid to hide myself. It was shameful, for
                some reason &mdash; but then for me, there&#39;s shame in everything.
                You hadn&#39;t seen yet, and kept driving as you responded.</p>
            <p>&quot;No, I&#39;m glad you came at all! It was such a nice sur&mdash; hey, you okay?&quot;
                You&#39;d noticed now, and it was the second time you&#39;d asked me that same question in about as many
                minutes.</p>
            <p>&quot;Canyoupulloverplease?&quot; I blubbered.</p>
            <p>You silently brought the car to a stop at the edge of the road.
                &quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m sorry,&quot; I mumbled.
                I leaned over toward you to hide my face in your collar.
                &quot;Is this okay?&quot; I managed to choke out. </p>
            <p>You were caught a little off guard, but you recovered quickly.
                &quot;Oh, yeah, of course it is!&quot; You said hurriedly, a little panic still in your voice.
                You put your arm around me and patted my back awkwardly.</p>
            <p>You didn&#39;t know what I was feeling - how could you?</p>
            <p>All this love inside me, and I couldn&#39;t tell you.
                I suppose I could have, but I didn&#39;t want to.
                I didn&#39;t want to screw it up.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m this way.&quot; I bawled.</p>
            <p>&quot;No, no, it&#39;s okay... what happened?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;It&#39;s nothing, I&#39;ll be fine,&quot; I choked out.
                Clearly it wasn&#39;t nothing, but you didn&#39;t push.
                A fit of sobbing took me over. I pulled back from you, and hid my face in my hands as I cried.
                I pulled at the box of tissues you had on the dash, and got a couple to wipe my face with.
                They weren&#39;t enough, and I went back for a couple more.</p>
            <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m using up - <em>*sob*</em> - your - <em>*hiccup*</em> - expensive
                tissues.&quot;
                I managed to laugh weakly, and you laughed with me.</p>
            <p>I reached for the little bottle of water in the side of the door.
                Our day of travelling had made me familiar with the inside of your car.
                I took a couple of swigs, and breathed deeply.
                &quot;I&#39;m sorry. I&#39;m fine now. Let&#39;s go.&quot;</p>
            <p>You wordlessly pushed the car back into the flow of traffic.
                We drove a couple of kilometers, almost the entire rest of the way to the airport, in silence, and I
                became painfully aware of my impending return to life back home - or lack thereof.
                We passed a row of shops, and I asked you if we could stop for coffee.
                You were doubtful.
                &quot;You sure you won&#39;t be late for your flight?&quot;</p>
            <p>&quot;Ehhh. We have a couple of hours, it should be fine. I could use a bit of fresh air anyway.&quot;
                I didn&#39;t, of course, say that at that moment I&#39;d have liked nothing more than to miss my flight,
                that I&#39;d have given anything for fifteen minutes longer.</p>
            <p>&quot;Ooookay then.&quot; You pulled over (too suddenly, causing the car behind us to honk angrily, which
                in turn caused me to flinch), and parked in a free spot near a small shop.
                The smell of fresh coffee wafted over as we walked toward the shop, and you went over to buy us coffee
                while I found a spot to sit down.
                You came back holding a tray with coffee, sugar, creamer, and a donut for each of us, and plonked it on
                the table.</p>
            <p>You tutted as I poured four packets of sugar in my coffee.
                &quot;You know I only drink coffee for the sugar and milk, right?&quot; I said, deadpan. &quot;If you
                just think about the coffee while mixing the sugar and milk that&#39;s enough for me.&quot;</p>
            <p>We made small talk.
                We talked about dogs and the little old lady in the village who&#39;d mistaken us for a couple, and the
                nice concierge at the hotel, and whether we&#39;d tipped enough.
                We talked about our plans for the rest of the week, and we talked about your upcoming move.
                We didn&#39;t talk about what had just happened in the car.</p>
            <p>We talked about how good the coffee was, and we munched on our donuts, and things were okay again for a
                bit.</p>
            <p>When we made it to the airport, you stopped the car and opened the boot.
                I pulled out my single article of luggage, my small trusty suitcase, and put it on the ground.</p>
            <p>&quot;I guess this is goodbye.&quot; I said.</p>
            <p>&quot;Mm-hmm,&quot; you agreed, but you didn&#39;t seem sad.
                There was a kind of carefree confidence in you that gave me hope that it wasn&#39;t the last time
                we&#39;d see each other.
                The little smile had returned to your lips.</p>
            <p>You hugged me, and I walked into the airport.
                Checking in felt like a blur, and I was on the plane before I knew it.</p>
            <p>As I waited for the plane to take off, I felt a familiar sinking begin in my chest.</p>
            <p>What was the point of going on? It felt like there was nothing to look forward to.
                All this love around me, so loud - and a deafening silence in my heart.
                And me, I was filled with love that had nowhere to go.</p>
            <p>Before coming to see you, I hadn&#39;t combed my hair in weeks.
                My apartment had been a mess.
                I&#39;d lain awake at night wondering where it had all gone wrong and why it hurt so much.
                Getting out of bed in the morning had been a chore.
                I&#39;d been feeling like a burden on everyone around me.</p>
            <p>I was surrounded by friends, yet it felt like I had no one of my own.
                For my stupid, selfish self they weren&#39;t enough.
                I needed you.</p>
            <p>I felt a little bit of hope then, though.
                Your smile, the light in your eyes - they were stuck with me.
                The way your hand felt under mine was burned in my memory.
                Knowing the things you&#39;d been through, I was filled with respect and admiration for you - how you
                went on spreading love and light and joy.
                And there I was, struggling not to cry on a plane.
                You were so beautiful.
                The most beautiful thing I&#39;ve known.</p>
            <p>Rage rose up in me. Me and my feelings - why couldn&#39;t I just be okay?</p>
            <p>Something inside me snapped.
                I needed to fix things.
                I needed help.
                I needed to be better again.</p>
            <p>And I needed to be yours. That was selfish, too. </p>
            <p>Love is as selfish as it is selfless.</p>
            <p>Before I put my phone on airplane mode, I sent you a text. &quot;I think I&#39;m in love with you.&quot;
            </p>
            <p>A first step? Maybe. I just didn&#39;t want to be afraid anymore.</p>
