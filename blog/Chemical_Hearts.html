                Today, I saw the film <i>Chemical Hearts</i> (2020, dir. Richard Tanne).
            </p>
            And it's fucking good.
            <p>This is a simple film, without any kind of gimmick, which is quite refreshing. Usually these kinds of
                films need some sort of glue to hold the plot together, be it the dead horse that is the premise of
                terminally ill kids falling in love, or something else rooted in fantasy (<i>cough</i> Twilight
                <i>cough</i>) to set the plot in motion, but this one didn't, and it was nice to see how they made that
                work.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film skips many of the cliched aspects of a lot of teen romance films, which was quite refreshing
                as well. It's an adaptation of a young adult novel called "Our Chemical Hearts" by
                Krystal Sutherland, and tells the story of an awkward, hopelessly-romantic teenage boy called Henry Page
                (a bit on-the-nose, if you ask me), who aspires to be a writer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Henry is intensely frustrated with the fact that while he is in the part of life where one is supposed
                to feel most alive and invincible, nothing particularly interesting is happening in his own life.
                The answer to his problem comes in the form of Grace Town, a girl from a neighbouring school who
                transfers into his school after she has an accident that leaves her walking with a cane.
                They meet when they're asked to co-edit the school newspaper, owing to their both being excellent
                writers, and the story picks up from there.
            </p>
            <p>
                I won't get into the details of it because I'm trying to avoid spoilers, but
                suffice it to say that the film deals well with the themes of grief, loss, love, growth, change, and
                coming-of-age that it takes on, which is no mean feat. It's a sweet story, with a side-message to all
                the confused, angsty teenagers out there that they aren't alone in this messy period of their lives
                alongside the main plot, and I think it accomplishes what it sets out to do.
            </p>
            <p>
                The film had a few (minor) issues with flow and consistency, and these made me feel that this was
                probably a longer script that got cut down to its current runtime. However, even with the (speculated)
                cuts, they made it work, and the result is an excellent slice-of-life film.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the dialogue felt overly lofty and philosophical at times but that's a liberty taken by most
                teen romances. It was usually fine, and this one doesn't handle it as badly as some others do.
            </p>
            The performances of the leads (Austin Abrams and Lili Reinhart) were really really good, and I liked
            basically
            all the characters, although one of Henry's best friends didn't really get much screen time or lines which
            makes me wonder why they included that character at all. Some of the tropes of filmmaking, both in general
            and of the genre in specific were done really well (for example a montage of the leads growing closer) and
            it felt like just a really well made film as a whole save for the few niggles I mentioned above.
            <p>
                Moving on, I'll say that the ending... wasn't what you'll expect. Again, the subversion was refreshing,
                and while the hopeless romantic in me protested, it was still quite satisfying.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maybe I'm biased, because I'm just a <i>sucker</i> for this kind of thing, but I <i>really</i> liked
                this film. Overall, I'd give it an <b>8.5/10</b>, and I wholly recommend it to anyone who's looking
                for a nice, satisfying romance drama to watch.
